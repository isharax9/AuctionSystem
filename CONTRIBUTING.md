## üìè Coding Standards

### Java Code Style

We follow standard Java conventions with some specific guidelines:

**Formatting:**
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Use braces for all control structures
- One statement per line

**Naming Conventions:**
- Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `AuctionServiceBean`)
- Methods: `camelCase` (e.g., `createAuction()`)
- Variables: `camelCase` (e.g., `auctionId`)
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_BID_AMOUNT`)
- Packages: lowercase (e.g., `com.auction.ejb`)

**Best Practices:**

```java
// Good - Descriptive names, proper formatting
public AuctionDTO createAuction(String title, String description, 
                               double startingPrice, int hours) {
    if (title == null || title.trim().isEmpty()) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Title cannot be empty");
    }
    
    Long auctionId = generateAuctionId();
    Auction auction = new Auction(auctionId, title, description, startingPrice);
    
    return convertToDTO(auction);
}

// Bad - Poor naming, no validation
public AuctionDTO ca(String t, String d, double p, int h) {
    Long id = cnt++;
    Auction a = new Auction(id, t, d, p);
    return toDTO(a);
}
```

**Documentation:**

```java
/**
 * Creates a new auction with the specified parameters.
 * 
 * @param title the auction title, must not be null or empty
 * @param description detailed description of the item
 * @param startingPrice the minimum starting bid amount
 * @param hours auction duration in hours
 * @return the created auction DTO
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if title is empty or price is negative
 */
public AuctionDTO createAuction(String title, String description, 
                               double startingPrice, int hours) {
    // Implementation
}
```

### EJB Specific Guidelines

1. **Always use Remote interfaces** for distributed access
2. **Mark transaction boundaries** explicitly with `@TransactionAttribute`
3. **Handle concurrency** with appropriate locking mechanisms
4. **Log important operations** using java.util.logging
5. **Validate all inputs** before processing

### Exception Handling

```java
// Good - Specific exception handling with logging
try {
    Auction auction = auctionService.getAuction(auctionId);
    if (auction == null) {
        throw new AuctionNotFoundException("Auction not found: " + auctionId);
    }
    return auction;
} catch (AuctionNotFoundException e) {
    logger.warning("Auction not found: " + e.getMessage());
    throw e;
} catch (Exception e) {
    logger.severe("Unexpected error: " + e.getMessage());
    throw new ServiceException("Failed to retrieve auction", e);
}

// Bad - Generic catch-all without context
try {
    return auctionService.getAuction(auctionId);
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
    return null;
}
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Requirements

- All new features must include unit tests
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Integration tests for complex workflows
- Performance tests for critical operations

### Test Structure

```java
@Test
@DisplayName("Should create auction with valid parameters")
void testCreateAuction_ValidParameters() {
    // Arrange
    String title = "Test Auction";
    String description = "Test Description";
    double startingPrice = 100.0;
    int hours = 2;
    
    // Act
    AuctionDTO result = auctionService.createAuction(
        title, description, startingPrice, hours
    );
    
    // Assert
    assertNotNull(result);
    assertEquals(title, result.getTitle());
    assertEquals(startingPrice, result.getStartingPrice());
    assertTrue(result.isActive());
}
```

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual methods and components
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **Concurrency Tests**: Test thread-safety and race conditions
4. **Performance Tests**: Validate performance requirements

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
mvn test

# Specific test class
mvn test -Dtest=AuctionServiceBeanTest

# With coverage
mvn test jacoco:report

# Skip tests (for quick builds only)
mvn package -DskipTests
```

## üí¨ Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes

```bash
# Feature
feat(auction): add auction duration validation

Add validation for auction duration to ensure it's between 1 minute and 7 days.

Closes #123

# Bug fix
fix(bid): prevent negative bid amounts

Added validation to reject bids with negative amounts. This prevents
data corruption and ensures auction integrity.

Fixes #456

# Documentation
docs(readme): update installation instructions

Updated GlassFish installation steps and added Docker deployment option.

# Breaking change
feat(api)!: change auction creation endpoint

BREAKING CHANGE: The auction creation endpoint now requires duration
in hours and minutes instead of just hours.

Migration: Update your API calls to include both durationHours and 
durationMinutes parameters.
```
